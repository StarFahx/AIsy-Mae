# AIsy-Mae
A discord bot for tracking turnip costs &amp; prices so that you can determine who to buy from/sell to!

## Installation
AIsyMae is currently a standalone project, and the libraries are not distributed with any package managers. You'll need to have a discord bot app set up (see https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and replace the discord API key placeholder text in appsettings.json with your bot's secret key. Then build the solution and run AIsyMae.exe!

## Usage
`!turnip-help` is a command that prints command documentation to the channel it is called in.

## Contributing
This project is deliberately small in scope. While I am aware that there are lots of things you might want to track about your friend group's Animal Crossing: New Horizons islands, I'm not accepting pull requests for additional functionality to track anything other than turnip prices at this time. While this app could be adapted to track more things, I'd like to rework it to better suit a more general tracking purpose if need be.

Pull requests for bugfixes, turnip-related features, and unit tests are welcome! I pulled this together in like four hours so it's quite bare-bones. Drop me an email at starfahx@gmail.com if you have any questions about contributing.
